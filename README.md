## What is "Sticky Cursor"?
Sticky Cursor is a technique to facilitate the task of moving target selection, by moving together with the target.

## ABSTRACT
There are many applications that consist of moving objects which require users to
select them with a cursor, such as 3D simulations, video games and air traffic control
systems. However, selecting a moving target via a cursor is much more difficult than
a static target. In this study, we introduce ”Sticky Cursor,” a technique that allows a
cursor to stick to (i.e. moving together with) a moving target before selecting it. We
believe this ”sticky” feature can facilitate the process of moving target selection. We ran
a user study to compare our proposed Sticky Cursor with a traditional cursor, which does
not stick to a moving target, for a moving target selection task. The results showed that
there was a little difference in the completion time of the task, but that the participants
were able to select the moving targets and more correctly than the traditional cursor.
Also, most of the participants preferred the Sticky Cursor to the traditional cursor. We
discussed the reasons and potential applications.
